A Tattoo Booking Platform & Portfolio website using Flask and Calendly.


## Why Did I Make This?

Instagram has been a major platform for finding and booking tattoos for the last 10 years. For most this works, but for others that want to decentralize their data (and more specifically move away from Meta maintained apps) this is an option to store your client data locally, and have an Instagram-like portfolio page.

## To Do

- [x] Portfolio Page
- [ ] Full Calendar/No Calendly
- [ ] Mobile Layout
